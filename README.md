# NixOS Config
Heavily WIP; a lot is broken, probably not done the proper way, and wonky.

## Installation

Requires existing NixOS installation with a user account.

Change all username occurances and edit where necessary (marked with `# NOTE: change [...]`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Opharg/nixos-config
mv nixos-config $HOME/nix # Config is supposed to be in the ~/nix directory
cd $HOME/nix
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
```

Rebuild NixOS with `rb`.
